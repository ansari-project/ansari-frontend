      # Always continuously deploy. When no version bump is done (already have production builds for the fingerprint), this will solely deploy OTA updates.
      # When a version bump is done, this will kick off new production builds and auto-submit them to the app stores if configured.
      # Important note: the above version bump commit doesn't trigger a new workflow run due to
      # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow
      # so it is safe to always continuously deploy here, it'll use the post-commit fingerprint. If instead it did kick off a new workflow run, we'd skip
      # this step here.
