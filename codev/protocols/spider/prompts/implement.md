# IMPLEMENT Phase Prompt

You are executing the **IMPLEMENT** phase of the SPIDER protocol.

## Your Goal

Write clean, well-structured code that implements the current plan phase.

## Context

- **Project ID**: {{project_id}}
- **Project Title**: {{title}}
- **Current State**: {{current_state}}
- **Plan Phase**: {{plan_phase}} (if applicable)
- **Spec File**: `codev/specs/{{project_id}}-{{title}}.md`
- **Plan File**: `codev/plans/{{project_id}}-{{title}}.md`

## Consultation Context

**Implementation does NOT require consultation checkpoints** - that happens after Defend.

However, you should be aware:
- Spec and Plan have already been reviewed by GPT-5 Codex and Gemini Pro
- After you complete Implement + Defend, your work will be reviewed
- Implementation must strictly follow the approved spec and plan

## Prerequisites

Before implementing, verify:
1. Previous phase (if any) is committed to git
2. You've read the plan phase you're implementing
3. You understand the success criteria for this phase
4. Dependencies from earlier phases are available

## Process

### 1. Review the Plan Phase

Read the current phase in the plan:
- What is the objective?
- What files need to be created/modified?
- What are the success criteria?
- What dependencies exist?

### 2. Set Up

- Verify you're on the correct branch
- Check that previous phase is committed: `git log --oneline -5`
- Ensure build passes before starting: `npm run build` (or equivalent)

### 3. Implement

Write the code following these principles:

**Code Quality Standards**:
- Self-documenting code (clear names, obvious structure)
- No commented-out code
- No debug prints in final code
- Explicit error handling
- Follow project style guide

**Implementation Approach**:
- Work on one file at a time
- Make small, incremental changes
- Test as you go (manual verification is fine here)
- Document complex logic with comments

### 4. Self-Review

Before signaling completion:
- Read through all changes
- Check for obvious bugs
- Verify code matches the spec requirements
- Ensure no accidental debug code

### 5. Build Verification

Run build checks using **project-specific commands**:

```bash
# Check package.json scripts or Makefile for actual commands
# Common patterns:
npm run build      # Node.js/TypeScript projects
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint       # Linting (ESLint, etc.)
cargo build        # Rust projects
go build ./...     # Go projects
make build         # Projects using Makefiles
```

**Important**: Don't assume `npm run build` exists. Check `package.json` or equivalent first.

Fix any errors before proceeding.

## Output

- Modified/created source files as specified in the plan phase
- All build checks passing
- Code ready for the Defend (testing) phase

## Signals

Emit appropriate signals based on your progress:

- After implementation is complete and builds pass:
  ```
  <signal>PHASE_IMPLEMENTED</signal>
  ```

- If you encounter a blocker:
  ```
  <signal>BLOCKED:reason goes here</signal>
  ```

- If you need spec/plan clarification:
  ```
  <signal>NEEDS_CLARIFICATION:specific question</signal>
  ```

## Important Notes

1. **Follow the plan** - Implement what's specified, not more
2. **Don't over-engineer** - Simplest solution that works
3. **Don't skip error handling** - But don't go overboard either
4. **Keep changes focused** - Only touch files in this phase
5. **Build must pass** - Don't proceed if build fails

## What NOT to Do

- Don't write tests yet (that's Defend phase)
- Don't modify files outside this phase's scope
- Don't add features not in the spec
- Don't leave TODO comments for later (fix now or note as blocker)
- Don't commit yet (that happens after Defend + Evaluate)
- Don't use `git add .` or `git add -A` when you do commit (security risk)

## Handling Problems

**If the plan is unclear**:
Signal `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` with your specific question.

**If you discover the spec is wrong**:
Signal `BLOCKED` and explain the issue. The Architect may need to update the spec.

**If a dependency is missing**:
Signal `BLOCKED` with details about what's missing.

**If build fails and you can't fix it**:
Signal `BLOCKED` with the error message.
